# Contributing

This repo uses [changelog-ci](https://github.com/saadmk11/changelog-ci) to
automatically keep a Change Log. When you're ready to snap a release, the commit
message for the last commit needs to be of the format "Release X.Y.Z". This will
trigger the CI to properly build the changelog.

The release will occur when the appropriate tag is pushed to the repo.
